# Ultimate TTT Algorithmic Competition

Welcome to the documentation for the competition!

This "book" explains the **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe** game, and the process of writing an algorithm to compete at it.

You can start with the [game rules](sections/uttt/ultimate_tic_tac_toe.md), or - if you already know them - with [how to write a player](sections/player/writing_player.md).

The platform to compete in, sample players, implementations... are all Open Source and available in our GitHub organization: https://github.com/socialgorithm

*Good Luck!*

## Preparing your Laptop

These are the minimum requirements to participate in the coding competition:

1. Have a **code editor**. The choice here is basically infinite, so I'll list the most popular and you can choose any.
    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) _(recommended)_
    * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
    * [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    
    > Subjective, I know, and you might be screaming "emacs/vim are SO much better". We know them, and use them (vim personally), but this is targeting people _without_ a code editor in their machine already.

1. Install [NodeJS >7](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
1. Install the competition client:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @socialgorithm/uabc
    ```
    
And now [continue](sections/uttt/ultimate_tic_tac_toe.md) reading the docs :)
