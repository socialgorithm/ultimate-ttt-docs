# Ultimate TTT Algorithmic Competition

Welcome to the documentation for the competition!

This "book" explains the **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe** game, and the process of writing an algorithm to compete at it.

You can start with the [game rules](sections/uttt/ultimate_tic_tac_toe.md), or - if you already know them - with [how to write a player](sections/player/writing_player.md).

The platform to compete in, sample players, implementations... are all Open Source and available in our GitHub organization: https://github.com/socialgorithm

*Good Luck!*
